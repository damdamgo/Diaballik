            <TextBlock Margin="0,10,0,0">Diaballik's rules are simple. Each opponent has a team composed of seven players, <LineBreak/>
                one of which has a ball. There is no mechanism to remove players, <LineBreak/>
                so there are always 14 players in the game.</TextBlock>
            <TextBlock Margin="0,10,0,0">The goal of the game is to bring a player to the opponent's side with the ball.</TextBlock>
            <TextBlock Margin="0,10,0,0">Opponents take turns and can optionally take three actions during their turn.<LineBreak/>
             A action is to move one player just one horizontal or vertical space or move the ball in any directions.</TextBlock>
            <TextBlock Margin="0,10,0,0">The player with the ball can throw his ball to another player of his team who is located<LineBreak/>
             in the vertical line, the horizontal line or a diagonal line and if no opposing player is in the way. <LineBreak/>
             As in handball, the player with the ball cannot move while he has the ball. So to move, the ball holder <LineBreak/>
             must pass to one of his partners. Moves can only be made in the horizontal or vertical direction and only if the destination<LineBreak/>
            is unoccupied. Moving diagonally requires two moves, since one must move horizontally, then vertically, <LineBreak/>
                in two stages (as such one cannot move diagonally between two pieces).</TextBlock>
